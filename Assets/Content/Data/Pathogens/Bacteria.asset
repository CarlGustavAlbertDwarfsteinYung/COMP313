  pathogenDescription: Bacteria are a type of biological cell. Typically a few micrometres
    in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and
    spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are
    present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs,
    radioactive waste, and the deep biosphere of the earth's crust. Bacteria also
    live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals. The study
    of bacteria is known as bacteriology, a branch of microbiology. In humans and
    most animals the largest number of bacteria exist in the gut, and a large number
    on the skin.[13] The vast majority of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless
    by the protective effects of the immune system, though many are beneficial, particularly
    in the gut flora. However, several species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause
    infectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, anthrax, leprosy, and bubonic
    plague. The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections.

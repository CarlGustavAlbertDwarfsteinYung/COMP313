  pathogenDescription: "A virus is a small infectious agent that replicates only
    inside the living cells of an organism. Viruses can infect all types of life
    forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.
    While not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell, viruses
    exist in the form of independent particles, or virions, consisting of: \n(i)
    the genetic material, i.e. long molecules of DNA or RNA that encode the structure
    of the proteins by which the virus acts.\n(ii) a protein coat, the capsid, which
    surrounds and protects the genetic material, and in some cases\n(iii) an outside
    envelope of lipids. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical
    and icosahedral forms to more complex structures. Examples of common human diseases
    caused by viruses include the common cold, influenza, chickenpox, and cold sores.
    Many serious diseases such as rabies, Ebola virus disease, AIDS (HIV), avian
    influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses. Some viruses can cause lifelong or
    chronic infections, where the viruses continue to replicate in the body despite
    the host's defence mechanisms. This is common in hepatitis B virus and hepatitis
    C virus infections. People chronically infected are known as carriers, as they
    serve as reservoirs of infectious virus. Horizontal transmission is the most
    common mechanism of spread of viruses in populations. Transmission can occur
    when: body fluids are exchanged during sexual activity, blood is exchanged by
    contaminated transfusion or needle sharing, exchange of saliva by mouth, contaminated
    food or water is ingested, aerosols containing virions are inhaled,and insect
    vectors such as mosquitoes penetrate the skin of a host,. The rate or speed of
    transmission of viral infections depends on factors that include population density,
    the number of susceptible individuals, the quality of healthcare and the weather.
    Epidemiology is used to break the chain of infection in populations during outbreaks
    of viral diseases."

  cellName: Eosinophil
  cellDescription: Eosinophils are a type of disease-fighting white blood cell. They
    are specialized immune cells responsible for combating multicellular parasites
    and certain infections in vertebrates. Along with mast cells and basophils, they
    also control mechanisms associated with allergy and asthma. They develop in the
    bone marrow before migrating into blood, after which they are terminally differentiated
    and do not multiply. These cells are eosinophilic or "acid-loving" due to their
    large acidophilic cytoplasmic granules

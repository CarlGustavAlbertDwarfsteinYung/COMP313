  cellName: Neutrophil
  cellDescription: 'Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that protect us from
    infections, among other functions. They make up approximately 40%-60% of the
    white blood cells in our bodies and are the first cells to arrive on the scene
    when we experience a bacterial infection. They are formed from stem cells in
    the bone marrow.

    Neutrophils are a type of phagocyte and are normally found
    in the bloodstream. They are recruited to the site of injury within minutes following
    the trauma and are the hallmark of acute inflammation; however, due to some pathogens
    being indigestible, they can be unable to resolve certain infections without
    the assistance of other types of immune cells.'

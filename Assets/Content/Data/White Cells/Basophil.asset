  cellName: Basophil
  cellDescription: Basophils are a type of white blood cell. Although they're produced
    in the bone marrow, they're found in many tissues throughout your body. They're
    part of your immune system and play a role in its proper function. If your basophil
    level is low, it may be due to a severe allergic reaction. Basophils appear in
    many specific kinds of inflammatory reactions, particularly those that cause
    allergic symptoms. Basophils contain anticoagulant heparin, which prevents blood
    from clotting too quickly. They also contain the vasodilator histamine, which
    promotes blood flow to tissues.

  cellDescription: Lymphocytes are white blood cells that are also one of the human
    body's main types of immune cells. They are made in the bone marrow and found
    in the blood and lymph tissue. Lymphocytes include natural killer cells for innate
    immunity, T cells for adaptive immunity and B cells for antibody-driven adaptive
    immunity. They are the main type of cell found in lymph, which prompted the name
    "lymphocyte".
